# Go Learning Docs

Welcome — this folder contains a structured set of guides to learn Go from installation to advanced topics. Start with `INSTALL.md`, then `GETTING_STARTED.md`, and follow the order or jump to sections that interest you.

Files included:

- `INSTALL.md` — Installing Go (Windows-first) and verifying setup
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` — Run/build programs and example commands
- `BASICS.md` — Syntax, variables, control flow
- `MODULES.md` — go modules and dependency management
- `TOOLS.md` — Useful tools & editor setup (VS Code)
- `TESTING.md` — Writing tests and benchmarks
- `ADVANCED.md` — Concurrency, interfaces, error handling
- `DEPLOY.md` — Building and cross-compiling
- `CHEAT_SHEET.md` — Common commands & quick reference
- `RESOURCES.md` — Helpful links and further learning

If you'd like a condensed single-file version, I can add `Golang-Guide.md` as an alternative.
