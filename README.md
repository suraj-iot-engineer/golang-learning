## 📘 About this repository
This repository is a personal learning workspace for Go (Golang). It contains concise, easy-to-follow examples, exercises, and notes that progress from basic concepts through advanced topics useful for backend and IoT development.

**Key descriptions:**
- **Backend-oriented** — Server-side concepts, HTTP services, concurrency, and tooling.
- **Beginner-friendly** — Clear explanations and well-commented example code for newcomers.
- **IoT-focused** — Examples and patterns useful for IoT backends and integrations.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Go fundamentals.
- Practice real-world backend patterns and idiomatic Go.
- Explore concurrency, networking, and IoT-related topics.
- Provide a self-contained learning path with runnable examples.

---

## 📚 Learning path & Contents
The examples are organized as small, focused exercises:

- `1_hello_world/` — Hello world and basic program structure
- `2_simple_values/` — Simple values and basic data types
- `3_variables/` — Variables and basic usage
- `4_constants/` — Constants and usage
- `5_for/` — `for` loops and iteration patterns
- `docs/` — Supplementary guides: getting started, testing, tools, etc.

More topics planned: conditionals, functions, error handling, structs, interfaces, goroutines & channels, networking, testing, modules, and deployment.

---

## 🚀 How to use
1. Install Go (see `docs/INSTALL.md` or visit https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. From the repository root, run examples directly, e.g.:

```bash
# run the hello world example
go run ./1_hello_world
```

3. Explore each folder's `main.go` (or `.go` files) and read the comments.
4. Try modifying examples and add exercises in new folders.

## 🤝 Contributing
This is primarily a personal learning repo, but contributions are welcome:
- Add new examples with clear comments and a short README for the example.
- Follow idiomatic Go and keep examples focused.

If you'd like, open an issue or a PR describing the addition.
