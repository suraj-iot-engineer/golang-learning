# 08. Advanced Go Patterns

This module explores advanced features and design patterns in Go, taking your skills from "user" to "architect".

## 📚 Topics Covered

1.  **Generics (Go 1.18+)**: Writing reusable algorithms.
2.  **Reflection**: Inspecting types at runtime (and why to avoid it).
3.  **Functional Options Pattern**: Configuring complex objects cleanly.
4.  **Middleware Pattern**: Chaining functionality.

## 🚀 Example
The example demonstrates:
- A Generic Stack implementation.
- The Functional Options pattern for server configuration.

```bash
go run main.go
```
